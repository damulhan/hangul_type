# Hangul Type
A JavaScript app to help with learning hangul, because I'm too lazy to do it like a normal person.

# To Do
* Add more word sets.
* Find a simpler way to store vocab.
* Add options (male and female, audio only mode, etc.).
* Add a timer and score keeper.
* Add users. (Rails? Node?)
* Clean up code.
